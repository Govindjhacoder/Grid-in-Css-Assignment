In CSS Grid Layout, the grid-auto-row and grid-auto-column properties are used to define the size of implicitly created rows and columns 
when grid items are placed outside the explicitly defined grid area. 
These properties allow you to set the size of the rows or columns that are automatically generated to accommodate the grid items.
